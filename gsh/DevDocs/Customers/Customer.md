#### Behavior
Customers are generated based off store rating.
A higher store rating can generate customers faster and with higher budgets.
Customers will be looking for certain items, but when happy they can buy related items.

Customers will want to try out certain items before purchasing, and will get upset if they have to wait to try an item or cannot find an item. They can also get upset if they have to wait to checkout. Their mood/tolerance will affect how long they are willing to wait.

A customers experience will be evaluated when they leave the store and can impact the store rating.

When a customer is trying out certain items, their skill rating will be used to pull audio clips.
