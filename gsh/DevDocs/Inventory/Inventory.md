# Inventory

Shop storage will be necessary space

Inventory space will be limited

It should be upgradable/expandable

A screen should be provided to show full inventory details with a very basic visual representation rendered on screen in the designated area

## Upgrades/Expansions
The raw floor area is usable space to get the player started

To expand inventory capacity, a larger storage area should be purchasable.

Racks with a given capacity should be purchasable that take up a given amount of floor space

Items on the showfloor do not take up inventory space but are still counted when viewing inventory details
